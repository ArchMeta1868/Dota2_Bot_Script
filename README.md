# Dota 2 Bot Script [7.37]

This is a Dota 2 Bot Script based off of Beginner:AI by (dota2jmz@163.com). Some changes are based upon other existing bot scripts; personal use mostly. Trying to get use to the API and code base.
Just trying to alleviate cheesiness and make bots movement more organic and objective base. It's a work in progress.

Evasion/damage reduction/aura items are just too good in bots games (since itemization isn't dynamic). It's also still very lineup dependent on how well they'll perform.

Worth noting that I also use a vscript to improve the bots GPM and XPM (AP only), and also have them able to get neutral items (Check Buff; Recommended to use).

To anyone who've found this or is using it, if you have any feedback in improving the script, kindly post them on the Steam Workshop page: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3139791706/4143942846477191222/

- ***To Use***
    - Since Valve hasn't fixed the workshop bug yet, bot scripts (that were uploaded after the bug occured) are only playable through local host lobby.
    - To use this:
        - Go to Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/scripts/vscripts. You will see that there is a `bots` folder inside. Either delete this folder or rename it.
            - Once you've deleted or renamed the bots folder, create a new folder called `bots`.
            - Download the files on this repo by going to `<> Code` and Under `Local`, select `Download ZIP`.
            - Extract the contents of the zip inside the `bots` folder.
            - Alternatively, if you have Git installed (ignore 2-3 from above):
                - Open Command Prompt inside the folder (Right Click on Windows 11). Type: `git clone https://github.com/ryndrb/dota2bot.git`.
                - The contents of this repository will then be downloaded. And everytime this repository is updated, open Command Prompt inside the `bots` folder. Type: `git pull` to update the files inside the folder.
                - ^ Or delete the contents of `bots`, then run `git clone` again, if no tinkered changes were made.
        - Then, launch DotA 2.
        - Click `Play Dota`. Under `Custom Lobbies`, select `Create`.
        - Under the `Lobby Settings` at the bottom, select `Edit`. Then, in the drop down `Radiant Bots` and `Dire Bots` menus, select `Local Dev Script`.
        - The `Server Location` must be `Local Host`.
        - Click OK, and it should be good to go.
            - The lobby has 5 slots
                -  1st is for Position 2 (Mid Lane)
                -  2nd is for Position 3 (Off Lane)
                -  3rd is for Position 1 (Safe Lane)
                -  4th is for Position 5 (Support Safe Lane)
                -  5th is for Position 4 (Support Off Lane)
        - (For non-Git) Everytime there is an update, you have to re-download the files and replaced the ones on the `bots` folder.
    - How I test:
        - Added in launch options: `+cl_clock_recvmargin_enable 0`
        - Bots v Bots
        - (Turbo, only if I'm testing spell and item usage/synergy; All Pick otherwise)
        - `Enable Cheats`
        - Type: `sv_cheats 1` in console.
        - Type: `host_timescale 2` or `host_timescale 4` in console.
        - Type: `script_reload_code bots/Buff/buff` in console (once the map has loaded).
        - Type: `host_timescale 0` in console to pause.

    - Supports that does damage, CC, or is Ranged are somewhat 'better' for the most part in bot games compared to Melee or non-. (Since positioning and movement are Valve default.)
